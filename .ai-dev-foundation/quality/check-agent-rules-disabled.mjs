//
// Only the three filenames Next.js itself accepts for configuration are
// checked (an unsupported extension such as .cjs/.cts is itself a Next.js
// config error, not this checker's concern). The order matters and matches

// lib/constants.js in 16.3.2: `['next.config.js', 'next.config.mjs',
// 'next.config.ts', ...]`) — if more than one candidate coexists (e.g.
// mid-migration between formats, or a stale file left behind), Next.js
// loads only the first it finds in that order, and this checker must
// inspect the same file Next.js actually loads. Checking a different one
// (an earlier version of this checker tried `.ts` first) risks reporting
// a config as disabled based on a file `next dev` never reads, while the
// file it does read still has agentRules enabled (Codex review finding on
// this PR).

// Matches a JS object property key that is EXACTLY `agentRules` — either a

// whose entire content is `agentRules` — not merely a substring of a
// longer key. Shared between AGENT_RULES_DISABLED_PATTERN and
// AGENT_RULES_KEY_PATTERN below so both apply identical key-boundary rules
// (duplicating this by hand in each pattern previously let them drift out
// of sync — see the fix history in this PR).
//
// The quoted alternative, `(['"])agentRules\1`, CONSUMES both quote
// characters as part of the match (the backreference `\1` requires the
// closing quote to be the same character as the captured opening one). An
// earlier version used zero-width lookaround (`(?<=['"])`/`(?=['"])`)
// instead, which only verifies a quote is adjacent without consuming it —
// that let the match end sitting right before the closing quote, so the
// callers' `\s*:` (which cannot skip over a quote character) then failed
// to find the colon, breaking the ordinary, documented `"agentRules":
// false` / `'agentRules': false` cases entirely (independently caught by
// both Codex and Claude review on this PR — no existing fixture actually
// exercised a quoted key at the time, despite one being named
// `disabled-quoted-mjs`). Consuming the quotes fixes this while still
// correctly rejecting `{ 'not-agentRules': false }`: at the position right
// before `agentRules` in that string, the preceding character is `-`, not
// a quote, so `(['"])` doesn't match there.
//
// The bare-identifier alternative requires the character immediately
// before `agentRules` to be `{`, `,`, or whitespace (or nothing — start of
// text) — `(?<![^{,\s])` is a negative lookbehind on "any character that
// is NOT one of those", which also vacuously holds at the start of the
// string, where there is no preceding character to fail it. This is
// deliberately narrower than only excluding identifier characters
// (`(?<![\w$])`, used by an earlier version): a legitimate unquoted object
// key can only be immediately preceded by one of `{`, `,`, or whitespace,
// so anything else — punctuation like `-`, another quote, etc. — is never
// a valid bare-key start. The earlier, looser lookbehind let `agentRules`
// embedded inside a quoted string right after a `-` (as in
// `'not-agentRules'`) slip through the bare alternative, since `-` isn't a
// `\w`/`$` character either. The lookahead `(?![\w$])` still requires
// nothing immediately after `agentRules` is an identifier character,
// rejecting `{ agentRulesExtra: false }`.

// below, only match a `key: value` colon form. JS object literals also
// allow a shorthand duplicate — `const agentRules = true; const nextConfig
// = { agentRules: false, agentRules };` — where the trailing bare
// `agentRules` (no colon) is shorthand for `agentRules: agentRules`
// (the outer binding) and, per the same last-duplicate-wins semantics
// documented on findLastAgentRulesKeyIndex() below, overrides the earlier
// `false`. Method (`agentRules() {}`) and accessor (`get agentRules()
// {}`) forms are the same class of gap. None of these are counted as an
// `agentRules` occurrence here, so a trailing one of these forms is
// invisible to this checker. Detecting them would require recognizing
// several additional JS object-member grammars beyond `key: value`, which
// pushes this filesystem-only, non-executing checker further toward being
// a real parser; it is also a dangerous-direction gap in principle, but
// requires deliberately naming an outer binding exactly `agentRules` and
// shadowing it with a same-named shorthand/method/accessor member in a
// `next.config` — not a plausible accidental construct — and is a further
// example of the "regex, not a tokenizer" bound already accepted
// repeatedly throughout this file.

// `false` must be the complete property value, not merely a prefix of a
// larger expression such as `agentRules: false || true` (which evaluates to
// `true`) — the lookahead requires whatever follows (after optional
// whitespace) to be a property/statement terminator or end of input, not
// arbitrary trailing expression text. `}` is included for defensiveness
// even though keepOnlyDirectProperties() below always blanks brace
// characters before this pattern runs, so a real `}` never reaches here.

//     checker report the config as disabled when it is not (the dangerous
//     direction: `next dev` still mutates AGENTS.md, but the check passed).
